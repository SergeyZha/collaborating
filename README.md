## Recipe 

### How to cook an egg:

<p>Heat the olive oil in a small, non-stick pan over medium heat. Crack the egg directly into the pan and season generously with salt and pepper. Cook for about two minutes, then use a spatula to flip the egg, being careful not to break the yolk. For a runny yolk, turn off the heat and let the egg sit for one minute.</p>
